description: Stories of Solidarity, is one response, among many, to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project seeks to archive and make visible the ways in which people and communities leverage existing social institutions and create new ones by tending and building practices of care, mutual aid, and solidarity.

##Process

###Discovery
**Client Needs:** In this phase in the project, my most important role was to be a listener. This step included many stakeholder interviews. This process was very iterative as the idea of what the team wanted for Stories of Solidarity was evolving with each meeting. The desire for the final product included an interactive virtual platform for sharing of experiences and actions of mutual aid and solidarity in communities witnessing some of the worst impacts related to COVID-19 and the accompanying shutdowns. The website was meant to be used for classes at Cornell University.

**Requirements gathering:** After I understood the needs, it was time to put these needs into requirements for the website. This included the following components: A map, a discussion board, video playing capability, and an about page.

**Research:** Once I understood the components of what is needed for the platform. I began conducting research as to what others have used and tried before, what the options looked like for each of the components involved. Social activism online presence, websites that utilize maps, interactive platforms, forums, social activism.
Planning.

**Structure:** During this part of the process, I created an organized structure/hierarchy of the pages and content of the page.

###Design
During this phase, I used Figma to design each of the components, pages, and interactions of the website. In order to test out my design, I first created a set of low-fidelity wireframes to be tested for usability with the client since there were not actual users to test with. After a couple of iterations, I created a high fidelity wireframe which most closely resembles the final product.

###Development
For developing the high-fidelity prototype, I used the following languages and tools: HTML, CSS, PHP, Mapbox (integrated), and Wordpress (integrated)

You can find the high-fidelity prototype here:

###Reflection
Reflecting back on the project, ideally there would have been additional time to iterate on the design of the website and conduct user testing. Check out this panel that my team and I did on Stories of Solidarity where we reflect on the experience and what we would have done differently: https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/stories-solidarity-covid-project-cornell
