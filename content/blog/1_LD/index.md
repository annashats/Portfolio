###My Role
Although I cannot share the details of this project due to confidentiality reasons, I can tell you a little about my experience there. For this project, as the sole designer on the team, I ...

- Designed the L&D storefront site accesible to 170K Deloitte professionals aimed to increase access to L&D resources in the firm
- Leveraged Design Thinking principles to conduct user testing for 40 users and utilized Human Centered Design (HCD) for over six mock iterations
- Maintained a balance between various stakeholder views (The CLO, L&D client counterparts, users, tech team), internal brand, timeline, and UX/UI best practices.
- Led tech meetings on requirements, escalated, and solved for critical issues.

###Reflection
This role was challenging in that there was limited room for creative freedom as I was designing for a limited capability Sharepoint site where we had many design and functional restrictions (Such as personalization for the users).
